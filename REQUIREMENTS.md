## Code Formating

 - Strive to fit your code into 80 characters per line, this is not always
    possible, but it is possible more often that you think.:)
 - One statement per line, no exceptions. Is it harsh? Yes, do I care? No. 
 What does it mean you say? If you write:

```javascript
I().find().your().lack().of().faith().disturbing();
```
 -    pull the cord from your computer and rewrite it like this:

```javascript
use()  
    .the()  
    .force()  
    .luke();  
```
## Naming Conventions

 - Classes start with a upper case letter and have no dashes, no underscores in
    their name.Use CamelCase. Javascript doesn't have classes, for the rest of
    this document think of javascript constructors as of Classes.
 - variable names start with lowercase letter and words are divided by
    underscore, no special characters allowed, basically:
    - Valid name can be : __ r/[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+/ __
